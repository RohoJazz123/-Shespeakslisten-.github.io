One of the Most Amazing people Ever! Ariana freaking Grande..<br>
</p>

	The other day Ariana took her twitter to tell about what horrifying happened to her.

<p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	She also shut down this bull real quick

		<p> When she shut down those stupid radio hosts.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p> Ariana Grande was never been afraid to shut down haters, for unpredictably bullshit, she does it with style and the compassion she is inspiring. Ariana Grande will always be the powerful feminist she is, and as I say to the haters Thank U Next Bitch.
